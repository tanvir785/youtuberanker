This is an app I developed in my free time using React/Redux that is used to gather information about a Youtube video such as views,comments and ratings. The ratings are calculated as a percentage of likes against total of likes & dislikes.

The project consumes Google's Youtube API and uses React JS/Redux tools to communicate with the REST API.

For CSS I have used Material UI, a popular React JS Web component that enhances design and functional capabilities of a React App (https://material-ui.com/) and also Semantic UI (https://semantic-ui.com/).

The project is available for public at: https://github.com/tanvir785/youtuberanker/ and is currently deployed online on a free Firebase site: https://ranker-40eda.web.app/

Git and Firebase are integrated as a workflow to deploy automatically when code changes are pushed for review to Git. More about this can be read at: (https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/github-integration)
